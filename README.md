# Case Context

Meta-Visit (MV)1 is a startup currently providing a virtual care technology platform to about 100 
general physicians (GP) in B.C. Their platform allows GP’s to attend to their patients via video 
calls, audio calls, and text messaging in an integrative manner and in compliance with privacy 
standards like HIPPA, GDPR, and PIPEDA/PHIPA, while automating backend administration 
like appointment scheduling and medical record management.
With the interests in digital health solutions among venture capitalists and investors at all time 
high due to the pandemic’s acceleration of digital health adoption, the VP of Growth at MV is 
tasked with developing a plan to build their own direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand, which directly 
provide virtual care services to the B.C. population.
When a B.C. resident uses a health care or wellness service (regardless it is virtual or in-person), 
the service can be paid for in three ways, namely (1) through the provincial government’s 
Medical Services Plan (MSP), (2) by the resident’s extended health care insurance, and (3) out of 
the resident’s own pocket. All GP’s and most specialists in B.C. are fully covered by MSP, 
which restricts the maximum number of patients a physician can see each day and standardizes 
the fees for individual services. On the other hand, non-MSP health services, particularly those 
can be efficiently and effectively delivered via virtual care, include but are not limited to nonreferral mental health counseling or therapy, non-referral dietitian, speech therapy, art and music 
therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorder and cancer patients. Given the physician shortage in B.C., 
MV decides to focus on delivering some of the non-MSP services via virtual care, with a plan to 
expand into wearable health tracking (prescription reminders or fall detection) or at home lab 
tests in future.
One of the first decisions the VP of Growth needs to make is WHO the new D2C brand should 
target. The VP thus recruited volunteers from the patients of the GP’s using the MV platform, 
asking them to fill out a questionnaire, and to give consent to use their non-medical platform 
usage data. The VP believes that a sample of patients with self-reported data via the 
questionnaire and platform usage, together with some publicly available geodemographic data, 
would allow some preliminary insights into the targeting decision. Specifically, the first question 
the VP would like to answer is WHO are the current “power users” of the virtual care with their 
GP’s?
While you are free to conduct any analysis with the below data variables, each team is expected 
to build a statistical/machine learning model, which can predict the power user in the sample of 
volunteer patients.
